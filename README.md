# NeDB with Promises

This is an extremly thin wrapper around the [NeDB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nedb) library, using [Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) with [tapsig](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tapsig).

Apart from the omitted callbacks, the API is exactly the same as in NeDB 1.8.
